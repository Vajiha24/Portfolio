## Data Analysis Projects
### 1. An analysis of Michelin starred restaurants worldwide 2020
Amongst the culinary world, there are few greater accolades for a restaurant than being awarded a Michelin star (or three!), or being listed as one of the best in the world by reputable guides. Foodies and fine dine lovers, see the experience of dining at one of these award winning restaurants, as just that, an experience, and thus take to looking at guides such as The Michelin Guide and The Worldâ€™s 50 Best Restaurants  - arguably the two most well known guides - to help determine which restaurant is next worth their time and money visit. 

But what is a Michelin star and how is it awarded? How exactly does the spread of Michelin stars and the top 50 restaurants look like not only across the UK, but also the world, and what more can we understand about the types of restaurants that have received these awards? Ultimately, which list should a foodie be looking at?
By extensively scraping and compiling data to enable exploration of both The Michelin Guide and The World's 50 Best Restaurants list, we will set out in this analysis to find answers to the above and determine a pattern of the types of restaurants rated as the most worth visiting around the world - and come to a conclusion about which guide is the most influential, giving the most worthwhile information for those seeking the best culinary experiences.
