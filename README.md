## Michelin guide 2020
Amongst the culinary world, there is no greater accolade than a restaurant being awarded a Michelin star (or three!). Foodies and fine dine lovers, like myself, see the expereince of dining at one of these award winning restaurants, as just that, an experience, and we take to looking at guides such as the Good Food Guide to help us determine which restaurant is next worth visting.

But how exactly does the spread of michelin stars awarded look like not only across the UK, but also the world? And what more can we understand about the types of restaurants that have these awards?

For this project, I have undertake extensive web scraping to gather data from across the world, to take a deeper look into the michelin star world.
